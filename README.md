As the name implies this repo is a raw implementation of AI from scratch, so there may be imperfections and bad naming of variables and so on. However, errors are my own and I certainly will listen to good feedbacks so send it my way if any.

The repo has two files in ```helpers``` folder: ```forward_pass.py``` and ```backward_pass.py```, forward pass is where I keep the forward propagation functions like ```affine_forward, relu_forward``` and ```backward_pass.py``` is where you can find the respective backpropagation functions. My work is very much inspired by karpathy's youtube lectures and stanford class: cs231n, so most of the things I have done here is from what I learned from those sources and in some cases I have just copied and pasted my work from assignments here not to re-write everything again.

```name_gen.ipynb``` is a name generator, which is implemented using numpy, it uses data from one of the other github repo: ```https://github.com/amitness/gender-data```, it contains ~8300 nepali names. I have used the seeding for the purpose of reproducibility so you will get the exact error rate and accuracy as I have. I got rid of seed in sampling but you can opt out by commenting that line as well.
